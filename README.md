# tensorflow-2.0-tutorials-with-models

This repo is meant to make it even easier to jump into tensorflow 2.0 by having prebuilt models ready for inference.

Most of the work from this repo is from the tutorials found in this page https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha

The jupyter notebooks here download or contain models that I already trained so you can see them working right away.
